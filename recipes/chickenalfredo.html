    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Alfredo on a weeknight? Yes! You can have this super kid-friendly chicken Alfredo on the table in 25 minutes. Rotisserie chicken makes it a snap, or you could use leftover chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken or cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup reserved pasta water</li>
        <li>Fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of water on the stove and bring to a boil. Salt liberally.</li>
        <li>Add the butter, cream, salt, black pepper, and nutmeg to small or medium-sized sauce pan. Heat over medium-low heat until the butter melts and the mixture comes to a slight simmer. Then turn heat down to low and simmer the sauce, stirring regularly to prevent scalding, until the sauce thickens slightly, enough to coat the back of a spoon easily. </li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until itâ€™s al dente, according to package. I always like to test it a minute or two before the package says it will be done to avoid overcooking. When pasta is cooked, reserve 1 cup of pasta water and then drain pasta. </li>
        <li> Return the cooked pasta to the pot and add the Alfredo sauce and shredded chicken. Continue to cook over low heat, stirring constantly to combine ingredients. Add cheese and continue to stir (I like to use tongs for this part). Sauce will thicken as you stir it with the pasta. If sauce seems too thick or gloopy, add reserved pasta water by the 1/4 cup to thin out the sauce slightly. You might not need any pasta water or you might need a good amount of it. </li>
    </ol>
