            <li>Dash freshly ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 pounds peeled and chopped tomatoes or 1 can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>About 16 sheets lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Preparing Bolognese Sauce</h4>
        <h5>Make Soffritto</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until onion turns pale gold. </li>
            <li>Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned. Sprinkle with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce. </li>
            <li>Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook. </li>
        </ol>
